# Toll fee calculator 2.0
A calculator for vehicle toll fees.

Toll Fee calculator is fully customizable in this implementation and accepts custom holiday list, fee table, what is defined a max fine per day and toll-free vehicle list.

Current repository language - CÂ¤

## Using the code

This serves as a core class library that can be used by client, such as an ASP.NET application. 

## Making further adjustments

To be able to expand on a TollCalculator, one could add CRUD functionality for TollFeeSpan Entity, using Entity Framework and a database connection, which in turn would be supplied to create a TollFeeTable that the TollCalculator can be adjusted with.
Client code can use Nager.Holiday package to supply up-to date country holidays.
Please take note that the domain code should not be adjusted for the need of EF or client code, so the use of DTOs and correct mappers will be required.

A calculator for vehicle toll fees.

* Make sure you read these instructions carefully
* The current code base is in Java and C#, but please make sure that you do an implementation in a language **you feel comfortable** in like Javascript, Python, Assembler or [ModiScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ModiScript) (please don't choose ModiScript). 
* No requirement but bonus points if you know what movie is in the gif

## Background
Our city has decided to implement toll fees in order to reduce traffic congestion during rush hours.
This is the current draft of requirements:
 
* Fees will differ between 8 SEK and 18 SEK, depending on the time of day 
* Rush-hour traffic will render the highest fee
* The maximum fee for one day is 60 SEK
* A vehicle should only be charged once an hour
  * In the case of multiple fees in the same hour period, the highest one applies.
* Some vehicle types are fee-free
* Weekends and holidays are fee-free

## Your assignment
The last city-developer quit recently, claiming that this solution is production-ready. 
You are now the new developer for our city - congratulations! 

Your job is to deliver the code and from now on, you are the responsible go-to-person for this solution. This is a solution you will have to put your name on. 

## Instructions
You can make any modifications or suggestions for modifications that you see fit. Fork this repository and deliver your results via a pull-request. You could also create a gist, for privacy reasons, and send us the link.

## Help I dont know C# or Java
No worries! We accept submissions in other languages as well, why not try it in Go or nodejs.
